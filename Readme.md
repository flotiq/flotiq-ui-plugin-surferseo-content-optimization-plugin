# SurferSeo integration plugin

## Usage

### Overview

This plugin integrates Surfer SEO into your application, enabling advanced text analysis for selected input fields. It
provides real-time SEO insights and recommendations, helping you optimize your content directly within your workflow.

### Configuration

The plugin requires you to select a Content Type Definition (CTD) and a rich text field for which the SEO analysis will
be performed. The analysis window will be displayed in the sidebar during content creation and editing, providing
real-time SEO analysis of the content from the selected rich text field. This seamless integration ensures that users
can optimize their content as they work, without needing to switch between tools

> **Note**: The plugin also supports optional fields such as title, whose content will be processed as an `<h1>`.
> lead, whose content will be analyzed as a `<p>` and FAQ, whose content will also be included in the analysis.

**The fields selected in the plugin configuration will be passed for analysis in the following format.**

```html

<body>
   <h1>{{Title}}</h1>
   <p>{{Lead}}</p>
   {{source}}
   
   <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
   <div>
       <h3>{{question.1}}</h3>
       <div>{{question.1}}</div>
   </div>
   <div>
       <h3>{{question.2}}</h3>
       <div>{{question.2}}</div>
   </div>
   {{...}}
</body>
```

It's worth noting that if an optional field is not selected, it will not be included in the analysis. For example, if
the title field is left empty, the `<h1>` tag **will not be sent for analysis.**
